Details for the project for group colloborators!


C++ for logic of puzzle input and puzzle creation.
Java for GUI of the puzzle
Java or C++ for connection to MySQL
MySQL for data storage and retrieval


Word layout plan:
The first answer will be lain horizontally
The next answer that shares any characters will be placed vertically
If a created answer has no matching characters to existing words, it will placed aside until a match is found.


Ideas:
only the answers and clues are stored, and the puzzle is visually recreated at time of puzzle program opening.
name the files as the time of creation to differentiate and sort them.
